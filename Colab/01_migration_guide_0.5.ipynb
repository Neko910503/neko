through the process of migrating your code from Qiskit Machine Learning v0.4 to v0.5.\n","\n","## Introduction\n","\n","The main focus of the 0.5 release of Qiskit Machine Learning is the migration of the base computational blocks like quantum kernels and quantum neural networks to the primitives introduced in Qiskit as well as extended support of the primitives in the algorithms.\n","\n","Contents:\n","\n","- Overview of the primitives\n","- New quantum kernel\n","- New quantum neural networks\n","- Other notable deprecation\n","\n","\n","## Overview of the primitives\n","\n","The core capability of quantum computers that sets them apart from from classical computers is their ability to generate non-classical probability distributions at their outputs. The native operations that one can do with a probability distribution is to sample from it or to estimate quantities on it. Consequently, these operations of sampling and estimating form the fundamental building blocks of quantum algorithm development. Thus, as it was [announced](https://research.ibm.com/blog/qiskit-runtime-for-useful-quantum-computing), two basic primitives were introduced, Sampler and Estimator, respectively, that implement these two operations:\n","\n","- Sampler class calculates probabilities or quasi-probabilities of bitstrings from quantum circuits. The base class is [qiskit.primitives.BaseSampler](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.primitives.BaseSampler.html).\n","- Estimator class estimates expectation values of quantum circuits and observables. The base class is [qiskit.primitives.BaseEstimator](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.primitives.BaseEstimator.html).\n","\n","Qiskit Terra provides core interfaces and two implementations:\n","\n","- The reference implementation that is statevector based. This implementation does require a backend or a simulator, it relies on the classes from the [quantum_info](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/quantum_info.html) package.\n","- The backend based primitives are to support provider/backends that do not support primitives directly. This implementation requires an instance of a backend to be passed to a primitive.\n","\n","More information on the Qiskit Terra primitives can be found in the [documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/primitives.html).\n","\n","It is worth mentioning other implementations as well:\n","\n","- Aer primitives should be used for Aer simulator. They extend corresponding interfaces from Terra and can be used in the same way as primitives from Terra. See [documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/aer_primitives.html) for more information.\n","- The runtime primitives to be used with IBM devices. This is an implementation that is focused on cloud computing on actual hardware.
